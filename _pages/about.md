I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the
University of Wisconsin - Madison.  My main research focus is on statistical 
and computational aspects of temporal data analysis and deep probabilistic
models in different areas, including computer vision and particularly
Brain Imaging. Check out my publications in the "Publications" tab. 

I'm looking for intern/full-time positions for Summer 2021! If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
